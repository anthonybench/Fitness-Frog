Run a debug build in **IIS Express**, and when it prompts you to revert to last stable build, click **Yes**.

### Contribute ü§ù
<hr>

This project is feature complete, and had no collaborators. I Made this application to explore older `.NET Framework` applications, as apposed to new `.NET Core` ones. I am not looking at any pull requests, but will always be glad to recieve constructive feedback. If you feel obliged, send a PR with **SUGGESTION** in the commit and comment that on the PR as well.

<br />

### Acknowledgements üíô

Thanks to *TreeHouse* for helping me through this application build, it really helped solidify a good `.NET` workflow and best practices.
